This repository holds the protocol definitions for Sirikata
(http://sirikata.com) which enable communication between
components: space, object host, and CDN. These are the protocols that
should be referenced to build new implementations.  For instance, they
are used in both the main C++ Sirikata repository
(http://github.com/sirikata/sirikata) and the JavaScript ObjectHost
implementation (http://github.com/sirikata/katajs).

This *does not* hold protocol definitions which are implementation
specific.  For example, the protocols used in the C++ code by space
servers to communicate with each other are stored in that repository
because they are not exposed to any other implementations.
